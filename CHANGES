  - The Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database (NNDb v2.0) contains datasets from 86 human participants doing the NIH Toolbox and then watching one of 10 full-length movies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).The participants were all right-handed, native English speakers, with no history of neurological/psychiatric illnesses, with no hearing impairments, unimpaired or corrected vision and taking no medication. Each movie was stopped in 40-50 minute intervals or when participants asked for a break, resulting in 2-6 runs of BOLD-fMRI. A 10 minute high-resolution defaced T1-weighted anatomical MRI scan (MPRAGE) is also provided.
